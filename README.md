# Me-wha
## Introduce
Me-wha is an application that helps students study math wherever they want.  
It provides 11 chapters of quiz so that students can choose what to solve. Each chapter has 20 quiz, which is varied by the level.  
In the f(x) tab, you can find folmula and notions you've forgotten.  
In the analyze tab, you can see your past test scores, and also analyze the changes through the graph.  
This is a high school project:)
